<h2>Adams Family</h2>
<p>WILLIAM ADAMS came from Edinburgh, Scotland to this country some time previous to 1795. He had been educated for the ministry and was very proficient in the classical languages. He decided, however, not to follow this profession and spent some time in the South as a teacher. He came to Vermont about 1795-7. In June 1797 he was admitted to the church at Barnet Center and the following year was chosen Clerk of the session. He married Lois Clark of Newbury and in the year 1800 bought the farm on Joe's Brook, which still remains in the Adams family.</p>
<p>At this time there was only a bridle path on the south side of the brook and up this path he came leading an ox upon which his wife was seated. He built a plank house below where the present house stands and nearer the brook and spent the rest of his life there. Upon his death in 1842 he was buried in Barnet Center Cemetery beside his wife and his daughter Nancy.</p>
<p>The children of William and Lois Adams were James 1799, died 1804; William 1801, died 1804; John 1803, died 1848; James 1805, died 1896; Nancy 1808, died 1847; William 1811, died 1896.
